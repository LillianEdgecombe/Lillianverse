## Anytime After Ten
Manchester – Islington, 2023

The radiator in Sarah’s studio had gone lukewarm again. It ticked like an anxious clock. She lay curled on the futon with a blanket over her head, her sketchpad half-buried under an open coat, and the tip of her tail twitching with each passing minute. The professor’s voice still echoed in her skull—“Interesting instincts, but no clarity of intention. Decorative, not structural.”

Decorative.

As if she were sewing curtains.

She stared at her phone, the screen dim, then lit it up with a thumb.

10:14 PM

She hesitated.

Then she tapped Call.

It rang three times. She almost hung up.

Then—“Hullo?” Sleepy, not annoyed. Familiar.

“Hey,” she said, trying to keep her voice steady. “Sorry. I know it’s late.”

“Doesn’t count as late for you,” Miles said gently. “You all right?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her throat was tight.

“Sarah?”

“Can I talk to you for a bit?”

“You can always talk to me.”

She pulled the blanket tighter. “It was a crit day.”

“Oh dear.”

“Yeah.”

“What happened?”

She told him. The way the professor had stared at her bronze piece as if it smelled funny. The way one of the other students had smirked when she tried to explain her process. The words that stayed longest were the quietest ones. “Don’t make your work about being furry. Let it stand without that.”

She let those words sit in the silence between them.

Miles finally said, “That’s bloody stupid.”

“I know.”

“You don’t sound like you know.”

“I don’t know what I sound like.”

He made a thoughtful little hum, the kind she used to hear while riding in the passenger seat of his old van, the one that always smelled like lavender oil and axle grease.

Then: “You remember the first time I pitched to the company board?”

“I was like... ten.”

“Yeah, but I told you about it later.”

“You brought cookies. They were still warm.”

He chuckled. “They were bait.”

Sarah sniffed, half laughing.

“I stood outside the conference room,” he continued, “in a too-big suit, holding my handouts like a bloody magician about to pull a rabbit out of a spreadsheet. And I wanted to puke. I could hear them laughing about something inside. I kept thinking, They’re going to see me. They’re going to know I don’t belong.”

She didn’t interrupt. She never did when he told stories.

“I nearly turned and walked out,” he said. “But then your mum—you know what she did?”

Sarah closed her eyes. “No. What?”

“She leaned in, looked me square in the eyes, and said, ‘They’ve never had someone like you in there before. That’s their problem, not yours.’”

Sarah swallowed.

Miles said softly, “You’ve never had someone like you in that room either. But you showed up.”

“She said my work didn’t have bones,” Sarah whispered.

“Love, your work has bones. It has teeth. That’s why it unsettles people.”

“They think it’s all... fur and girl feelings.”

“And that’s not allowed?”

She let out a laugh that sounded like a sigh.

“I hate that I care so much what they think.”

“It means you’re paying attention. Doesn’t mean they’re right.”

A long pause passed. The hum of city outside the window. Someone yelling at a dog. The radiator giving up.

Sarah asked, quietly: “Did you really think you didn’t belong back then?”

Miles’s voice softened. “Every single time I walked into a room with suits and ties and people who knew how to pronounce charcuterie. But then I remembered... I knew things they didn’t. About rhythm. About people. About engines. And your mum reminded me, even if I forgot.”

“Who reminds you now?”

“You do.”

She blinked hard at the ceiling.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“You don’t need to thank me.”

“I’m glad I called.”

“I’m glad you did too.”

They stayed on the line. No rush. Just the quiet breath between two sides of the same old thread.

Miles eventually said, “Want me to send you a voice note for the morning?”

“Sure.”

“Right then. It’ll say: ‘Make something messy. Then make it honest.’ That sound good?”

Sarah smiled into the dark. “Perfect.”
