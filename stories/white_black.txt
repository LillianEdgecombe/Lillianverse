## White Walls, Black Notes
Brixton, 2005

The basement smelled like damp concrete and burnt toast. Someone upstairs had clearly given up on their grill. The walls were white in theory, but most of the paint had chipped into flaking islands. A space heater rattled in one corner like it was coughing.

Lillian stood near the mic, fidgeting with the hem of her shirt. Her tail bumped into the amp every time she shifted her stance. The cord tangled at her feet didn’t help. Her voice was warm but uncertain, like a kettle left just under the boil.

“We could just try it from the chorus,” Miles said, crouched behind a cheap, borrowed drum kit with a snare that kept sliding to the left.

Lillian adjusted her glasses. “It’s not the chorus I’m worried about.”

“You always nail the chorus.”

She didn’t answer.

The air was thick with rehearsal tension—too many wires, not enough progress.

Milla bustled in ten minutes late, arms full of sheet music and coffee in a chipped thermos. Her round, ruddy face peeked out from behind her cello case.

“I brought notes!” she chirped.

Miles looked up from tuning his floor tom. “Late notes.”

“I got lost! The bus did that thing where it became a different number halfway through.”

Lillian offered her a grateful smile. “Glad you made it.”

Milla beamed, then set about wedging her cello between two folding chairs.

“Is Juno coming?” she asked.

Lillian nodded. “She texted. Running behind.”

“She always runs behind,” Miles muttered.

Lillian cast him a sharp look.

“She does!” he added, hands raised. “I’m not judging! I’m timing.”

Before anyone could reply, the door creaked again, and Juno slipped in, tall and hushed like a shadow that forgot to knock. She wore a jacket far too big for her, open over black jeans and a grey hoodie. Her contralto voice, when she finally spoke, was low and smooth.

“Hey.”

Everyone gave a vague greeting.

“We were about to start,” Lillian said gently, her nerves softening just a little at the sight of her.

Juno gave a small nod and moved to the second mic, checking the cord without a word. She didn’t meet anyone’s eyes.

Miles counted them in with his sticks—four-tap, simple time—and they launched into the first number: a cover of Since I’ve Been Loving You. But it was a shamble.

The kick pedal squeaked. The bass amp hummed. Lillian missed the entry by half a beat and came in too loud, too forward, like she was trying to sing at the band instead of with them. Her voice cracked on the third line. She winced.

They stumbled through to the end.

Milla set her bow down delicately. “Well, that was heroically bad.”

“No one’s playing in the same world,” Miles muttered.

“I’m sorry,” Lillian said quickly. “I—I wasn’t ready.”

“You’re always ready,” said Milla, more gently this time.

“No. Not tonight.”

They all stood around for a minute, letting the flop air out of the room.

Juno finally spoke, her voice low: “Do you want to try it a different way?”

Lillian blinked. “Like how?”

“I can follow you.”

“No harmony?”

“Not at first.”

Miles sighed. “Fine. But I’m counting us in again, and this time let’s stay in key.”

He raised his sticks.

Tap. Tap. Tap-tap.

They began again.

Lillian’s voice came in quieter this time. Less like a performance, more like a sound she’d carried in her chest all day. It was weary, raw, and true.

She rounded the first verse, steady now.

Then—on the second verse—Juno joined her.

Not loud. Not pushing. Just there.

A lower harmony, like dusk beneath a summer sun. The line curved around Lillian’s, shadowing her, supporting her.

Milla’s cello slid in behind them, warm and sure, and the pulse of it grounded them all. Even the heater seemed to stop rattling.

Miles adjusted, softening the snare, leaning into the groove instead of forcing it.

For the space of one verse and a rising chorus, they stopped being four separate musicians in a bad room.

They became sound.

The music filled the basement. Lillian’s breath deepened. Her hands stilled. She didn’t look at Juno, but she leaned toward the mic without thinking. Their voices, different as smoke and salt, braided into something new.

And when the song ended, there was silence.

Real silence.

Juno stepped back. Milla put down her bow like it was glass. Miles looked stunned.

Lillian turned, blinking behind her glasses.

“That,” she whispered, “was it.”

Juno shrugged, eyes on her shoes. “It felt... okay.”

“It felt real,” said Miles.

“Bigger than us,” Milla added.

Nobody moved for a full ten seconds.

Then Miles exhaled, grinning. “Now that’s a band.”

Lillian sat down on the amp, heart pounding. “Can we do it again?”

They did.
