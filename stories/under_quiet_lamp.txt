## Under the Quiet Lamp
Brixton, 2004

The front door stuck the way it always did, even after Miles had kicked it three times. The latch finally gave with a shudder, and the two of them stumbled in like a pair of overpacked students breaking into a squat.

Lillian stood in the narrow hallway, surrounded by boxes and air that smelled like hot dust and old paint. Her shirt was sliding off one shoulder; her thick frame was wrapped in stretch cotton and humidity. She kicked off her boots and exhaled.

“Well,” she said, “it hasn’t shrunk.”

Miles squeezed past her, dropping a duffel bag onto the upright Yamaha by the living room wall. “Feels smaller, though.”

“It feels like someone lived here alone for too long.” She turned, hands on broad hips. “And now she’s going to have to make room.”

Miles looked around the flat—the yellowing walls, the slanted bookshelf, the twin mattress they’d hauled in from the second-hand shop. The heat from outside still clung to the floorboards. A small electric fan buzzed like a dying insect.

“I can be small,” he offered, though he was grinning.

“You’re enormous,” Lillian said, swatting him with a dish towel. “You take up entire sofas.”

“I fold up.”

“You sprawl. Like a dog on holiday.”

“But I *am* a dog on holiday.”

She let out a little snort and went to open the window. The air didn’t move.

They were both sweating. It didn’t matter.

They collapsed onto the new double bed mattress—no sheets, just the slightly plastic cover and a folded blanket. Lillian adjusted her glasses, then flopped fully onto her back. Her long hair fanned out like ink in water. Her breasts shifted under her top and she didn’t care. Her thighs were stuck together, and she didn’t care. She looked over at Miles with a tired, sideways grin.

“We now live here.”

Miles was lying flat, eyes on the ceiling. “That we do.”

“This is your life now,” she said. “I sing off-key in the shower and leave cups everywhere.”

“I can't believe you'll ever be off-key. Anyway, I forget to replace the toilet paper.”

“I’ll put books in the fridge.”

“I’ll borrow your socks and not confess.”

She reached out and tapped his knee. “Still want this?”

He didn’t look over—just nodded. “Always wanted this.”

There was a silence that wasn’t awkward, just full. Eventually, he said, “We should eat.”

They ordered takeaway—Vietnamese, from the place near the station. Spring rolls, warm noodles, sticky sauces. When the knock came at the door, they scrambled together to answer it, both laughing as they jostled in the tight hallway. Miles paid. Lillian kissed the top of his head.

They ate on her—their—usual kitchen table, chopsticks in paws. Lillian’s curls stuck to her forehead. The noodles were spicy and perfect.

“This is the best meal I’ve ever had,” she said through a mouthful.

Miles gave her a look.

“What?” she said.

He leaned in and kissed her nose. “Nothing. You just... look like a person I’ve known forever.”

She didn’t reply. She took another bite, cheeks a little pink beneath her fur—not from heat.

Later, as they packed away the empty boxes into corners and tried to find the power strip for the kettle, they discovered Miles forgot his toothbrush. "We'll have to share," she replied, hold her own up like a relic.

Miles grinned. “We can share.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Romantic.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Intimate.”

She rolled hers. “Temporary.”

Still, when she handed it to him that night, after brushing her own teeth first, they both laughed.

They lay in bed with the fan on low, the lamp still glowing its soft, sickly yellow.

Miles spoke into the quiet. “Do you think we’ll last?”

Lillian turned her head toward him. “If we don’t, I’m keeping the piano.”

“Deal. But I get the toothbrush.”

They both cracked up, a little too loudly for the hour, and then softened again.

He reached over and found her hand.

And just like that, with noodle breath and a shared toothbrush, they began.
