## Two Hearts

The snow hadn’t yet stuck to the cobblestones of the mews, but it dusted the windowpanes like sugar. Lillian sat on a cushion by the radiator, a big hardback book of shapes in her lap, though she hadn’t turned a page in nearly twenty minutes. Her small, black-furred paws were folded in her lap, and her nose twitched every so often—half from the dry air, half from something harder to name. Her round glasses had slipped halfway down her nose.

Her mother Margaret was humming in the kitchen. Not singing, just something quiet and tuneless to fill the silence. She stirred two mugs on the stove—not in a rush, not for show. Just cocoa, the good kind.

“Darling?” Margaret said gently, glancing toward the sitting room. “You haven’t moved in a while.”

“I’m thinkin',” came Lillian’s small voice, unusually still.

Margaret wiped her hands and walked over. Her housecoat smelled of citrus and cardamom. “Big thoughts?”

Lillian nodded, nose twitching. “I wanna change my name.”

Margaret blinked but didn’t laugh. “Oh?”

“I don’t want it anymore.”

Margaret sat beside her daughter on the floor, and looked her over. Lillian had thick black-and-white fur, a soft puff of a face, and little glasses she insisted on wearing, though she didn’t need them. Her stubby tail was curled beneath her legs like a question mark. “Can I ask what brought this on?” Margaret said carefully.

Lillian shrugged hard, still looking at her book. “It’s a silly name. Too *fluffy*.”

Margaret tilted her head. “I always thought it was a lovely name.”

“Becca says it’s a cartoon name. A badger name.” Her lip wobbled. “She said I should be called... Socks. Or Muffin.”

“Those aren’t very good names for a person,” Margaret said mildly.

“She said I’m not a real girl. Just an animal.” Lillian stood quiet for a second, her eyes far away beyond the book in her lap. “She laughed and laughed.”

The words hung in the room like frost on the sill.

Margaret’s voice was quiet, but full of that unshakeable mother-sound that always reminded Lillian of things being folded, washed, and put back where they belonged.

“And what do you say?”

Lillian shrugged, suddenly small again. “I don’t know. I don’t look like many of the kids in school. Or like you. Or pops.”

Margaret nodded and took her daughter’s paws gently in her hands. “Come on, kettle’s done. We need cocoa.”

She led Lillian back into the kitchen. The air was warm and cinnamon-sweet. On the counter sat two mismatched mugs—one white with little red foxes, the other a chipped green enamel. Lillian pointed at the fox one, and Margaret gave it to her. She pressed both paws around it and sniffed the steam.

They sat together on the window bench, looking out at the soft flakes still trying to become snow.

“I’ll tell you something,” Margaret said. “When you were born, pops and I didn’t have a name ready. We thought we would, but when we saw you—well, we realized none of the ones we’d planned quite fit. You weren’t a Fiona. Or a Maisie. And certainly not a Beth—or Becca. We had to guess it.”

“Did you guess Lillian?”

“We did. After your Gran’s middle name. She was a brave lady.”

Lillian sipped, then asked softly, “Was I furry when I came out?”

Margaret sipped her cocoa. “You were soft like a velvet glove. Bit squeaky. Not scary.”

“Did I look like a person?”

“You looked like *our* person.”

That quieted them both for a moment.

Lillian pulled her knees up. “Why did I come out like this?”

A question the entire world still couldn't figure out. A question that had no answer. Margaret didn't need answers, though: whatever the culprit, it was no matter for her. She had Lillian, and that was enough. She sipped her cocoa. “Because the world’s still figuring itself out. And sometimes, it makes something brand new.”

“I don’t like bein’ brand new,” Lillian mumbled.

Margaret looked over. “Too lonely?”

Lillian nodded.

“Well,” Margaret said, “you're not the only one. You'll find out. More are being born every day. And even if you were the only one—you’re ours. That’s not lonely.”

Lillian was quiet. Her mother gave her a small smile. “So. What name would you like instead?”

That made Lillian blink. Her cocoa steamed gently in her lap. “I was thinking,” Lillian said, “maybe... Helen?”

“Mh. Sounds like someone who reads lots of books.”

“I like books,” Lillian offered, but didn’t look sure.

“What else?”

“Emma?”

“Very good name. That one’s hard to spell, though. Two M’s. Think you could handle that?”

Lillian giggled.

They tried a few more. Zoe. Lark. Minnie. Lillian wrinkled her nose at all of them.

Margaret leaned closer. “Still want to change it?”

Lillian looked down into her mug. “No... I like my name. It’s just... people laugh.” She whispered, “Do you think I’ll meet other furry kids like me?”

Margaret reached out and smoothed a tuft behind her daughter’s ear. “The world is catching up. Slowly, but it is. So, yes, you'll do. Who knows, maybe you'll make good friends with them.”

“Why did it make me like this?”

She tapped Lillian’s chest gently. “I don’t know, my love. But I think whatever made you knew the world needed a Lillian who looked like you. Who could walk into a room and make people stop and think." 

Lillian didn’t answer, but she leaned against her mother’s side and let the silence stretch.

After a while, Margaret asked, “Still want to change your name?”

Lillian thought hard. “No.”

“No?”

“But I don’t want to be just... normal Lillian. Can I be the shiny kind of Lillian?”

Margaret smiled. “The shiny kind?”

“Like, gold. Big. Strong.”

“Oh, sweetheart,” Margaret said, raising her mug, “you already are.”

They clinked their mugs. Outside, the snow finally started to stay.
