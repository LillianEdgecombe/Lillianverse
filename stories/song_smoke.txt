## A Song for the Smoke
London, 2005

The fog had slipped into Brixton sometime between dusk and eleven, and now it clung to the windows like something that had come to stay. Lillian sat cross-legged on the piano bench, staring at the keys, her back warm from the radiator, her front lit only by yellowish, cheap brandy-like, light of the lamp.

The flat smelled of old varnish, fried onions, and the kind of dust you couldn’t quite clean—just move around.

Miles was out, covering a late shift. She didn’t mind. Not tonight.

She had started to hum. Not a real tune—just breath with shape, edges pressed into the quiet. Her throat was dry, and her hands trembled when she reached for her phone. The buttons made a soft click as she dialed.

It rang twice.

Then: “Hallo?”

“Mum.”

“Oh, darling. It’s late, you all right?”

Lillian exhaled. “Just needed a voice. Yours.”

Margaret Edgecombe didn’t ask for more. She never did. There was the sound of something being set down—maybe knitting, maybe a teacup—and then that steady, familiar presence at the other end of the line.

For a while, neither of them spoke.

Then Lillian said, “It’s so loud here.”

“Even at night?”

“Especially at night. There’s shouting. Cars. Music with no tune.”

Margaret hummed. “Cities have lungs. They don’t sleep.”

“This one doesn’t breathe right,” Lillian said, trying to laugh. “I spent so much time getting... *attuned* to something that was *not me* that... now that I found something real... everything seems unreal.” She let her gaze drift toward the fogged window. Somewhere past the glass, the streetlight cast a golden bruise onto the pavement. It reminded her of church light. The kind you saw on old stones, filtered through dusty glass. “I miss trees,” she said.

“You’ve got that tiny patch out back.”

“It’s weeds and two bins, Mum.”

“They count.”

Lillian smiled, despite everything. “And the academy... it’s not like what I thought.”

“Too posh?”

“Too *clean*.” She leaned forward, elbows on knees. “Everyone sings like they’re trying to get hired, not like they’ve lived something. There’s no dirt. No crackle.”

“You like the crackle.”

“I am the crackle. And I think they hear it when I open my mouth.”

There was a pause.

“They don’t like your sound?”

“They don’t know what to do with it.” She looked down at her body. “Or with me.”

Margaret’s voice came gently. “Tell me.”

“Some of the tutors... they look past me. Like they’re not sure I’m part of the same conversation. Or like I’m here by mistake.”

“You’re not.”

“I know. But I’m the only anthro teaching there. Yet.”

Another silence, softer this time.

“You know,” Margaret said slowly, “when I was your age, I spent a week in the Highlands with your aunt Liz. Got completely lost in fog one morning—took a wrong turn on a trail. I couldn’t see more than an arm’s length.”

Lillian leaned her cheek against the phone.

“You know what saved me?” Margaret said.

Lillian shook her head, forgetting she couldn’t be seen.

“I sang. I didn’t even think about it. Just opened my mouth and sang an old hymn. Couldn’t tell you which. But Liz heard it and found me.”

There was a pause, and then Lillian asked, “Do you think I should come home?”

Margaret didn’t answer right away. Then: “No. But you should sing.”

“I don’t know what to sing.”

“Doesn’t matter. The song finds you.” Lillian could see her mother smile at the other side of the call. “It always had and always will do.”

Lillian looked at the keys. She hadn’t touched them all day.

And then—without thinking—she began to hum again. This time it had a shape, a spine. It was nothing she’d rehearsed. Just long vowel sounds, low and steady. A call with no words. The kind of sound that might echo through stone.

She placed one hand on the keys. Played a chord. Another. The left hand followed.

She sang.

It was rough, unfinished, honest.

She sang until her eyes blurred, until her breath caught, until the flat no longer felt like it might collapse in on her. Until the fog outside pressed up against the window like a witness.

And when she finished, she waited.

The silence on the line was thick.

Then, quietly, Margaret spoke.

“I’m still here.”

“I know.”

“You wrote that?”

“Just now.”

“I’ve never heard your voice like that.”

Lillian pressed her palm against the piano’s wooden edge. “I didn’t mean to make you cry.”

“It’s a good thing, sweetheart. A strong thing.” They sat in silence for a while. Then Margaret said, “That’s what you take back with you. That song. That sound. It’s yours.”

Lillian nodded. Her voice was hoarse when she said, “Thank you.”

“For what?”

“For being... somewhere I can call when the city’s too much.”

“That’s what mums are for.”

She stayed on the line for a while longer. They talked about nothing: the weather in Edinburgh, whether Miles had remembered to replace the milk, what book her dad had fallen asleep with this time.

But something had already shifted. The fog was still there, yes. The weight of not being understood, the rawness of newness, still sat in her chest.

But now she had something else.

She had a song for the smoke.
