*London. Late autumn. Damp leaves, dim lights, and a badger lost in thought.*

Lillian Edgecombe was walking home from the Academy, her scarf tugged up to her snout and her mind wrapped tight around Marisol. The young vixen had stormed out of rehearsal again—fur bristling, cello bow left behind like a gauntlet. So much talent, so much anger. Lillian had seen that spark before, in herself, in others. It could be brilliance. Or it could burn everything down.
She used to be able to turn that spark into brilliance, more often than not. Marisol could be soothed, could be tamed. But she had to want to become a star, instead of a comet. And that wasn't part of Lillian's job-something out of her control, something she was afraid of.

The streetlights blurred as she blinked too long. A chilly drizzle was clinging to her coat’s shoulders, soaking in. Her paws, stiff from cold and overuse, her bag too heavy with papers she didn't want to grade that night. She turned onto Mandela Street, where the houses leaned in like old friends and the concrete still remembered their younger footsteps.

Her thoughts slowly started drifting int he calm alleys—first to Marisol, then to the band, then to Miles. Their words earlier had been quiet, but sharp. He’d stood in the kitchen doorway, ears pinned back, voice low.

>“You’re burning the candle from both ends again, love.”
>
>“I’m fine.”
>
>“You haven’t been fine for days.”
>
>“And what would you have me do, Miles? Let them slip through the cracks? Let them go away and crash-burn themselves? When you know-when *I* know I can make them feel fine?”

She hadn’t waited for his reply. She hadn’t wanted to hear his hurt.

Her boots splashed through a shallow puddle. She didn't notice the delivery van edging out of the alley. It was silent on electric wheels, the driver checking their mobile.

White headlights catched the silver in her whiskers.

The world jerked sideways. A flash—bright, deafening—and then a soft, sudden silence.

She felt weightless, falling backward into velvet dark. Frayed time. Scattering thoughts. Music notes, faces, laughter—familiar and unfamiliar—rushed past her like pages in a book torn loose.

A hallway not from this world: endless doors, and behind them, lives she doesn’t yet remember living.

And then—
Nothing.
