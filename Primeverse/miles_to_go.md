# Miles to Go

The delivery truck was forty minutes late, and Miles Ferguson could feel the familiar tension building between his shoulder blades as he watched the loading dock through his office window. The pain radiated in a pattern unique to canid anthros—a consequence of spending too many hours upright in a world designed for bipedal humans. Tuesday mornings were always challenging at the Islington branch of Hartwell & Sons Grocers, but today felt particularly fraught—three staff members out with flu, a refrigeration unit making ominous grinding noises, and now this.

His mobile buzzed: a text from the driver. Traffic nightmare on A1. ETA 20 mins. Sorry mate.

Miles rubbed his temples, feeling the weight of his responsibilities settle around him like a familiar coat. His claws clicked lightly against the screen as he typed a brief acknowledgment. At forty-two, he'd been managing this branch for eight years, working his way up from stock clerk through sheer determination and the kind of methodical problem-solving his father had drilled into him during those lean years in Manchester. The journey hadn't been easy—each promotion requiring twice the effort of his human counterparts, each achievement scrutinized for evidence that a German Shepherd couldn't possibly handle management responsibilities.

He glanced around his office—the desk positioned to accommodate his tail, the ergonomic chair specially designed for anthro spines, the slightly lower computer monitor that acknowledged his natural eye level. Small accommodations he'd had to fight for, one budget request at a time. The previous manager had left everything at human height, seemingly oblivious to the physical strain it caused.

"Mr. Ferguson?" Jenny, one of the newer cashiers, appeared in his doorway. She was human, barely twenty, and still intimidated by having an anthro supervisor. Her eyes never quite met his, always landing somewhere around his chest. "There's a customer asking for you specifically. Says there's an issue with his standing order."

Miles nodded, straightening his tie. "I'll be right there." He rose, feeling the familiar twinge in his lower back—a reminder of yesterday's inventory shift when the specialized lifting equipment had malfunctioned, forcing him to adapt with his body rather than the tools designed to prevent exactly this kind of strain.

The customer was Mr. Pemberton, a regular who'd been shopping at Hartwell's since before Miles had started working there. Elderly, well-dressed, with the kind of accent that suggested private schools and inherited wealth. He was also, Miles had learned through years of careful interactions, casually racist in the way that some older humans were—not malicious, exactly, but operating from assumptions that made every conversation a small minefield.

"Ah, Ferguson," Pemberton said as Miles approached. "Good to see you. Though I must say, I'm rather disappointed with the service lately. My usual order was completely wrong last week."

Miles pulled up the order on his tablet, scanning the details. Everything looked correct. "I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Pemberton. Can you tell me specifically what was wrong?"

"Well, for starters, the lamb was completely the wrong cut. I specifically requested leg, and what I received was clearly shoulder. Any competent butcher would know the difference."

Miles checked the order again. Leg of lamb, as requested. He made a mental note to speak with the butcher, though he suspected this was less about the actual cut of meat and more about Pemberton's discomfort with being served by anthros. The butcher, a stocky bull terrier named Raj, had been with the store for fifteen years and knew his cuts better than anyone in North London.

"I'll look into that immediately," Miles said evenly. "And I'll make sure your next order is personally overseen."

"See that you do." Pemberton's tone carried the particular dismissiveness that Miles had learned to navigate without reaction. "I've been shopping here for thirty years, you know. Since before... well, before things changed."

The implication hung in the air between them. Before the Anthro Integration Act of 1983. Before anthros were allowed to work in customer-facing roles. Before someone like Miles could rise to management. Before the world had shifted in ways that made men like Pemberton feel displaced in spaces they'd once considered exclusively theirs.

"We appreciate your loyalty, Mr. Pemberton. I'll personally ensure your next order meets your expectations." Miles maintained his professional smile, careful not to show teeth—a habit ingrained from years of human interactions where any display of canine dentition, no matter how benign, could be interpreted as aggression.

After Pemberton left, Miles retreated to his office and closed the door. He sat heavily in his chair, feeling the familiar weight of having to be twice as good, twice as careful, twice as professional as his human counterparts. It was exhausting in a way that had nothing to do with the actual work.

He reached into his desk drawer for the anti-inflammatory medication his doctor had prescribed—formulated specifically for canid physiology, not the human-standard painkillers that had caused him liver problems three years ago. Another small battle won: convincing the company health plan to cover species-appropriate medication rather than the cheaper human alternatives that were at best ineffective, at worst dangerous.

His phone buzzed again—this time a call from head office. Regional manager, probably wanting an update on the quarterly figures.

"Miles? It's Davidson. How are things looking for Q2?"

"On track," Miles replied, pulling up the relevant spreadsheets. "We're actually up three percent from last quarter, despite the staffing challenges."

"Excellent. Listen, I wanted to give you a heads up—there's talk of opening a new branch in Camden. Corporate is looking for someone to head up the project. Your name came up."

Miles felt a flicker of interest, quickly tempered by caution. Opportunities like this didn't often come to anthros, even ones with his track record. "What would that involve?"

"Full management role, bigger budget, chance to implement some of those efficiency protocols you've been developing. It would mean a significant step up, salary-wise. Interested?"

"Very," Miles said carefully. "When would you need an answer?"

"Take your time. Think it over, discuss it with your wife. We're not looking to move on this for another few months."

"One question," Miles added, before Davidson could end the call. "The new location—would it include the accessibility modifications we've been discussing? The adjustable workstations, the species-appropriate break areas?"

A pause on the line. "That would be part of the budget discussion, certainly. Why?"

"Because it matters," Miles said simply. "Not just for me, but for the staff. For recruitment and retention. For creating a workplace that actually works for everyone."

"I'll make a note," Davidson said, his tone suggesting this was a novel consideration rather than a basic necessity. "We can discuss it further when you've made your decision."

After the call ended, Miles sat staring at his computer screen, mind racing. A promotion. A real one, not just increased responsibilities with the same title. The kind of opportunity he'd been working toward for years.

But it would mean longer hours, more pressure, more situations like the one with Pemberton. More proving himself over and over again to people who would always see his species before his competence. And if the new branch wasn't designed with anthro needs in mind, it would mean starting that fight all over again—the endless small battles for basic accommodations that humans took for granted.

The delivery truck finally arrived at noon, forty-seven minutes late. Miles spent the next two hours dealing with the fallout—rescheduling staff, reorganizing the stockroom, calling suppliers to adjust tomorrow's deliveries. By the time he looked up, it was past six, and the store was closing.

He paused at the butcher counter on his way out. Raj was cleaning his equipment with the meticulous care that had made him one of the store's most valuable employees.

"Pemberton complained about his lamb order," Miles said without preamble.

Raj looked up, his ears flattening slightly. "Let me guess—wrong cut?"

"Apparently you can't tell the difference between leg and shoulder."

A snort. "I've been butchering meat since before that old human was born. Did you tell him that?"

"You know I didn't." Miles leaned against the counter, suddenly tired. "Just... double-check his next order, will you? I don't need the headache."

"Sure, boss." Raj's tone was understanding rather than resentful. They'd both been at this too long to take it personally. "How's the back today?"

"Better since I got the right medication. That specialist you recommended—Dr. Patel—she actually understands canid physiology. Made all the difference."

"Told you." Raj wiped his paws on his apron. "My cousin saw her for his hip issues. First doctor who didn't try to treat him like a human with fur."

The drive home through London traffic gave Miles time to think. About the promotion, about Pemberton's casual dismissal, about the constant low-level stress of being one of the few anthros in management at a traditional company. About the new Workplace Accommodation Act that was supposed to address these issues but remained unevenly enforced. About Lillian, waiting at home, probably already starting dinner.

Lillian. The thought of her settled something in his chest, the way it always did. Not because she fixed his problems or made them disappear, but because she saw him—really saw him—in ways that had nothing to do with his job or his species or his ability to navigate human prejudices.

He took a detour, stopping at a small specialty shop in Highbury. It was one of the few places in London that catered specifically to anthros—everything from clothing designed for tailed bodies to foods that acknowledged different digestive systems. The owner, a sleek otter named Marina, greeted him by name.

"The usual, Miles?"

"Please." He watched as she selected a bottle of wine—a vineyard that specifically produced varieties suited to canid palates, with their more sensitive noses and different taste receptors. It was an extravagance, but tonight felt like an occasion that warranted it.

"Rough day?" Marina asked, wrapping the bottle carefully.

"The usual," Miles echoed, with a wry smile. "But potentially interesting developments."

"Sounds promising." She handed him the package. "Give my best to Lillian. Tell her we're still waiting for her to bring that band of hers in for our cultural night."

"I'll remind her."

The house on Leconfield Road was warm and welcoming, lights glowing in the kitchen windows. Miles let himself in through the back door, hanging his keys on the hook by the entrance. The house itself was a testament to their life together—gradually modified over the years to accommodate their bodies, their needs, their particular ways of moving through the world. Doorframes slightly higher than the human standard, countertops at varying heights, furniture built for bodies with tails. A home that acknowledged who they were rather than forcing them to adapt to spaces designed for others.

"You're late," Lillian observed from the stove, but her tone held no reproach. She was wearing the blue dress he particularly liked, the one that brought out the richness of her black fur. Her broad badger form moved with a grace that still captivated him after all these years—the solid strength of her, the deliberate precision of her movements.

"Delivery issues," he said, loosening his tie. "And Pemberton."

Lillian's ears flicked—a small sign of irritation on his behalf. She didn't ask for details; she knew the type of day he'd had from those two words alone. This was one of the gifts of their relationship: the shorthand they'd developed, the way they could communicate volumes with minimal words, with ear movements, with the subtle language of scent that humans couldn't perceive.

"Dinner can wait," she said, turning to face him fully. "Bath first."

It wasn't a suggestion. Miles felt something in his shoulders release at the gentle command, the way Lillian took charge of his care when he was too tired to manage it himself. This was their language, developed over twenty years of marriage—the way she could read his exhaustion and respond to it, the way he could surrender control when the weight of being responsible for everything became too much.

He handed her the wine, a peace offering of sorts. "From Marina's shop."

Lillian examined the label, her expression softening. "Special occasion?"

"Maybe." He followed her upstairs, his body already anticipating the relief to come. "Davidson called about a promotion. New branch in Camden."

The bathroom was already prepared—hot water, lavender salts, candles casting soft light across the tiles. Another example of their adapted space: a tub large enough for his frame, with supports that accommodated the different way canid spines distributed weight in water. Lillian helped him undress, her paws gentle but efficient, taking care of him the way she might tend a garden or prepare a meal. With attention, with love, with the understanding that some things couldn't be rushed.

The hot water was a revelation. Miles sank into it gratefully, feeling the day's tensions begin to dissolve. Lillian sat on the edge of the tub, her paws working shampoo through the fur on his head and neck, her touch careful around his ears. The scent of the shampoo—formulated for anthro fur, not human hair—filled the steam-warmed air.

"Tell me about the promotion," she said, her voice pitched low in the way that always soothed him.

"New branch in Camden. Full management role. Better salary." He closed his eyes, surrendering to her ministrations. "But it would mean starting over with all the accommodations. Fighting the same battles for basic recognition. More Pembertons."

"And?"

"And I'm not sure it's worth it. The constant explaining, the justifying, the educating. Sometimes I just want to do my job without having to be an ambassador for my entire species."

Lillian's paws moved to his shoulders, working at the knots of tension there. "You don't have to decide tonight. Or tomorrow. Or even next week."

"I asked about including proper accommodations in the new location. Davidson acted like it was a novel idea rather than a legal requirement."

"Of course he did." Lillian's tone was dry. "Humans have the luxury of never having to think about these things."

"The new Workplace Accommodation Act is supposed to address this. But enforcement is spotty at best."

"So make it a condition of taking the role." Lillian's paws didn't pause in their work. "You have leverage, Miles. You're their top-performing manager. Use that."

She helped him rinse his fur, then wrapped him in a warm towel, her movements unhurried and deliberate. This was what he needed—not just solutions or advice, but simply to be cared for. To remember that his worth wasn't determined by his job or his ability to navigate other people's prejudices.

"Raj recommended a specialist for my back issues," Miles said as they moved to the bedroom. "Dr. Patel. She actually understands canid physiology. Prescribed medication that works without destroying my liver."

"Good." Lillian helped him into comfortable clothes—loose pants with a tail accommodation, a soft shirt that didn't irritate his fur. "I've been saying for years you needed a proper anthro doctor, not those human physicians who treat you like an unusual case study."

"She's part of that new integrated practice in Hampstead. The one that has both human and anthro doctors working together. Apparently they're doing research on species-specific healthcare needs."

"About time." Lillian's tone was approving. "Maybe they can finally address that arthritis in your left paw properly."

Later, they sat together on the sofa, Miles's head in Lillian's lap as she played with his ears in the absent way that always made him drowsy. She was humming something—a melody he didn't recognize, probably something she was working on for the band. The wine from Marina's shop sat open on the coffee table, its rich aroma filling the room.

"Asim called earlier," Lillian said, her paws gentle in his fur. "The band has been invited to play at that new anthro-owned venue in Shoreditch. The one that's actually designed for performers with tails and different body types."

"That's good." Miles felt a surge of pride for her. "Better than that place in Camden where you couldn't even fit your keyboard through the door."

"Much better. They actually have adjustable microphone stands and stage lighting that doesn't overheat fur. And the owner is pushing back against that ridiculous new licensing requirement that tried to classify anthro performances as 'exotic entertainment.'"

Miles growled softly at the reminder. The recent attempt to regulate anthro artistic expression under the same laws as adult entertainment had been a particularly insulting form of discrimination. "Any progress on that front?"

"The Anthro Artists' Alliance is challenging it in court. Felix's cousin is one of the lawyers working on the case." Lillian's paws moved to the base of his ears, finding the spot that always made him melt. "They're arguing it violates the Cultural Expression Protection Act."

"Good." Miles closed his eyes, letting the tension of the day continue to ebb away. This was what home meant—not just the physical space adapted to their bodies, but the emotional space where they could discuss these realities without having to explain or justify or educate. Where they could simply be.

"I love you," he said quietly, the words carrying more weight than usual. Not just affection, but gratitude. For this house, this life, this woman who saw him as more than the sum of his struggles.

"I know," Lillian replied, her paws gentle in his fur. "I love you too."

The promotion could wait. The decision could wait. For now, this was enough—the warmth of home, the comfort of being known, the quiet strength that came from being loved not despite his vulnerabilities, but because of them. In a world that constantly demanded he justify his existence, his home with Lillian was the one place where he never had to explain.

Miles closed his eyes and let Lillian's humming carry him toward sleep, feeling safe in the knowledge that whatever tomorrow brought, he wouldn't face it alone. The world outside might be designed for bodies unlike his, filled with people who saw his species before his personhood, but here, in this house, with this woman, he was simply Miles—not a category or a curiosity or a problem to be solved, but a person, whole and complex and loved.

And that, more than any promotion or professional recognition, was what sustained him. The knowledge that he was seen, truly seen, by the one who mattered most.
