# House Rules

The late afternoon light filtered through the kitchen window at 37b Leconfield Road, casting golden squares across the worn wooden countertops where Lillian Edgecombe arranged stems of white peonies in a ceramic vase she'd thrown herself. Her broad paws moved with deliberate precision, each flower positioned just so, the way she approached everything—as if the smallest gesture carried weight beyond its appearance.

She stepped back, adjusting her large rounded glasses, and surveyed the kitchen table. The good china, the one with the delicate blue rim that Miles had found at a Camden market years ago, caught the light. Three place settings, though Sarah would likely sprawl across two chairs anyway, her long golden limbs never quite fitting conventional arrangements. The chairs themselves had been specially modified—wider seats with a gap at the back to accommodate her tail, a small but significant adaptation in a world where furniture rarely acknowledged bodies like hers.

"Miles?" Lillian called toward the back garden, her voice carrying the particular cadence that meant attend to me now . Not harsh, never harsh, but unmistakably clear. She felt her throat vibrate with the subtle rumble that accompanied her words—a badger's natural vocalization that she'd learned to incorporate rather than suppress, one of many small ways she'd come to embrace her species-specific traits rather than hide them.

Through the window, she watched her husband's familiar silhouette emerge from the shed, his German Shepherd ears pricked forward at her call. Even after twenty years, that immediate response to her voice sent a warm pulse through her chest. He wiped his paws on the old towel hanging by the door—engine grease, probably, from whatever project currently occupied his evening hours.

"The Chablis needs chilling," she said when he appeared in the doorway, his brown eyes already scanning the kitchen for what she might need. "And check the shed door—I don't want it banging if the wind picks up."

Miles nodded, moving past her to the wine fridge with that particular economy of motion she'd learned to read like sheet music. His shoulder brushed hers as he passed, a brief contact that spoke volumes in their private language. I see you. I'm here. What else? The subtle press of his muzzle against her neck—a quick scent-marking gesture invisible to human eyes but deeply meaningful between them—added another layer to their wordless communication.

Upstairs, the floorboards creaked—Sarah, finally stirring from her afternoon sprawl across the guest bed. Home for the weekend from Manchester, she'd arrived yesterday evening with paint under her claws and that particular exhaustion that came from wrestling with canvas and losing.

Lillian smoothed her dress—deep burgundy silk that complemented her black fur and made her feel substantial rather than simply large. She'd chosen it deliberately, the way she chose everything for these small gatherings. Not performance, exactly, but presentation. The careful curation of an evening that would unfold like music, each moment building toward something larger than its parts. The dress had been custom-made by a tailor who specialized in anthro proportions, one of the few who understood that badger women needed room across the shoulders without assuming they wanted human waistlines.

"Mum?" Sarah's voice drifted down the stairs, followed by the sound of bare paws on wood. "Are Asim and the others coming?"

"Just us tonight," Lillian called back, checking the lamb in the oven. "Quiet dinner."

Sarah appeared in the kitchen doorway, all golden fur and angular limbs, wearing an oversized jumper that had probably belonged to Miles at some point. At twenty-eight, she still moved through their house like she was testing the permanence of her welcome, though she'd been theirs for twelve years now.

"I was sketching in the garden," Sarah said, settling into her usual chair—the one that let her stretch her legs toward the radiator. "The light's different here than in Manchester. Softer."

Lillian hummed acknowledgment, the sound carrying approval without making too much of the observation. Sarah had always been sensitive to being watched too closely, praised too obviously. Love, in their house, was often expressed in the spaces between words.

"The studio space at school is all wrong," Sarah continued, her claws tapping a restless rhythm against the table. "The windows are too high—designed for human height. I have to stand on a stool to get decent natural light."

Miles returned with the wine, setting it in the ice bucket with the particular care he brought to all of Lillian's requests. "Shed's secure," he reported, then paused. "Sarah, there's something in the garden you might want to see. That sketch pad you left out—the wind caught a page."

Sarah's ears flattened slightly. "Is it ruined?"

"No," Miles said, his voice gentle. "But it's... interesting. The way it landed against the fence. Like it was meant to be there."

They moved to the garden as a unit, the three of them, their different gaits finding a common rhythm. Lillian's solid, deliberate steps; Miles's efficient, controlled stride; Sarah's lighter, more tentative pace. The sketch—a study of the house's back windows—had indeed caught against the garden fence, but the wind had folded it in such a way that the drawing seemed to emerge from the wooden slats themselves, as if the house were dreaming itself into existence.

"It's beautiful," Lillian said simply, and meant it.

Sarah studied the accidental installation for a long moment. "I've been thinking about impermanence lately. How things change when you're not looking."

Lillian felt Miles's attention sharpen beside her—that particular quality of listening he brought to moments when Sarah edged toward the deeper currents of her thoughts. They'd learned, over the years, not to push. Sarah's revelations came like her art: in their own time, in their own way.

"The lamb will be ready soon," Lillian said, which was both true and a gentle invitation back to the present moment.

As they returned to the house, Miles paused at the back step, his nose twitching slightly. "Rain coming," he said, with the certainty that came from senses sharper than either of theirs. Another small reminder of their different perceptions of the world—his keen sense of smell detecting changes in air pressure and moisture that Lillian could only guess at.

Dinner unfolded with the easy rhythm of long familiarity. Sarah told them about her professors, her current project, the way Manchester felt both too small and too large depending on her mood. Miles shared the small dramas of the grocery chain—a delivery truck breakdown, a new supplier who couldn't seem to understand that punctuality mattered.

"The new regional manager visited today," Miles said, cutting his lamb with precise movements. "Human, of course. Spent the whole time talking over my head to my assistant manager. Thomas. Also human."

Lillian's paw found his knee under the table, a brief pressure of understanding. These small indignities were familiar territory—the subtle ways humans sometimes refused to acknowledge anthro authority, especially in Miles's case, where his species carried stereotypes of servitude rather than leadership.

"What did you do?" Sarah asked, leaning forward with interest.

Miles's ears flicked—amusement, not distress. "I let him finish his little performance. Then I showed him the quarterly numbers. My store outperforms every other branch in London."

"And then?" Lillian prompted, knowing there would be more.

"And then I mentioned that my wife teaches at the Royal Academy of Music, and suddenly he was very interested in whether we might attend the same charity functions." Miles's smile showed just a hint of teeth. "Amazing how quickly humans recalibrate when they realize you might move in the same social circles."

Sarah snorted, a sound that carried both amusement and recognition. "My sculpture professor does the same thing. Ignored me completely until he found out about your pottery exhibitions, Mum."

Lillian watched them both, noting the way Sarah's shoulders relaxed as the evening progressed, how Miles's attention never quite left her even when he was speaking. This was what she'd orchestrated, really—not just a meal, but a space where they could all remember who they were to each other.

"How's your back been?" she asked Miles, noticing the slight stiffness in his movements as he reached for his wine glass.

"Better," he said, though the set of his ears suggested otherwise. "The new doctor actually listened when I explained that canid spines aren't structured like humans'. Suggested some exercises specifically for quadruped-derived posture issues."

"That's a change," Lillian remarked. The medical establishment's failure to properly account for anthro physiology was a constant frustration—from inappropriate medications to examination tables designed for bodies unlike theirs.

"Felix's mother finally found a specialist," Miles added. "Someone who understands rodent-specific cardiac issues. It's made a world of difference."

After dinner, Sarah disappeared upstairs while Lillian and Miles cleared the table. Their movements around each other were choreographed by years of practice—he rinsed, she dried, he put away the good china while she wiped down surfaces. The kitchen itself had been subtly modified over the years to accommodate their needs—counters at the perfect height for Lillian's shorter stature, cabinet handles designed for paws rather than fingers, a floor that provided proper traction for padded feet.

"She's struggling with something," Miles observed quietly, his voice pitched for her ears alone.

"She's always struggling with something," Lillian replied, but not unkindly. "It's how she makes sense of the world."

Miles nodded, understanding. They'd learned early that Sarah's art wasn't separate from her healing—it was the mechanism by which she processed a childhood that had been more absence than presence. They couldn't fix that for her, could only provide the steady ground from which she could explore it.

"I saw her medication in her bag," he said, even more quietly. "The new one. For anxiety."

Lillian's paws stilled on the dish she was drying. "Did she mention it?"

"No." Miles's ears flattened slightly. "I wasn't prying. The bottle fell out when she was looking for her sketchbook."

"We don't ask," Lillian reminded him gently. This was one of their house rules—unspoken but essential. Sarah's autonomy was sacred, especially regarding her health. Too many authorities had made decisions for her before she came to them.

"I know." Miles's tail gave a single, frustrated swish. "I just wish..."

"That we could fix everything for her," Lillian finished. "But we can't. And she wouldn't want us to try."

Later, as Lillian played piano in the living room—something soft and unfinished, a melody that had been haunting her for weeks—Sarah reappeared with something in her paws. The piano had been another adaptation, modified by a specialist to accommodate Lillian's broader paws and different joint articulation. The music she created on it was uniquely hers, impossible to replicate on an instrument designed for human hands.

"I found this," Sarah said, settling onto the sofa beside Miles. "In the guest room, tucked behind the bedside table."

It was a photograph, slightly faded: Sarah at sixteen, the night she'd first come home with them. She was curled in Lillian's lap on this very sofa, both of them looking exhausted and uncertain and hopeful all at once. Miles must have taken it, though Lillian had no memory of him doing so.

"You kept this?" Sarah asked, looking at Miles.

Miles's ears flicked slightly—embarrassment, perhaps, or something deeper. "I kept a lot of things from that first week. Wasn't sure... wasn't sure if you'd stay."

The admission hung in the air between them, honest and vulnerable in the way that only happened in their house, in these quiet moments when the day's performances fell away.

"I wasn't sure either," Sarah said softly. "But I'm glad I did. Stay, I mean."

She hesitated, then added, "I've been thinking about doing a series on adoption. Anthro adoption, specifically. The legal frameworks are still so new, especially for cross-species families like ours."

Lillian's paws found a different melody on the keys, something warmer, more resolved. "You know we had to petition for special consideration," she said. "The standard forms assumed human parents or same-species placement."

"I remember the hearings," Sarah said, her voice taking on a harder edge. "All those questions about whether you could 'properly socialize' me without knowing my birth species."

Miles made a low sound in his throat—not quite a growl, but adjacent to one. "As if humans had any business judging proper socialization when they're the ones who left you in that warehouse."

"It's changing, though," Lillian said, her paws still moving across the keys. "The new Anthro Family Rights Act recognizes multi-species households. Makes the process easier for families like ours."

"Too late for us," Sarah observed, but without bitterness.

"But not for others," Miles said. "That's something."

Outside, the wind had picked up as predicted, but the shed door held firm, and the house around them felt solid and permanent and theirs. Through the window, Lillian could see the first drops of rain that Miles had predicted earlier, confirming his weather sense once again.

Sarah tucked the photograph into her sketchbook, and Lillian understood that it would become something else—transformed, interpreted, made new while honoring what it had been. That was Sarah's gift: taking the fragments of her life and arranging them into something beautiful and whole.

"I might use this," Sarah said, tapping the photograph. "For an installation piece. About memory and belonging."

"Your art, your choice," Lillian said simply. Another house rule: Sarah's story was hers to tell, however she chose to tell it.

The evening wound down with the natural rhythm of a family that knew each other's needs. Sarah would stay up late, sketching by lamplight. Miles would check the locks, turn off the lights, perform the small rituals that marked the end of his day. And Lillian would play piano until her paws grew tired, letting the music carry away whatever tensions the day had held.

But for now, they sat together in the living room, the three of them, listening to Lillian's improvised melody and watching the way the lamplight caught the edges of their shared life. House rules, Lillian thought, weren't really about rules at all. They were about creating space for love to exist in all its complicated, imperfect forms—a space designed not for the world's expectations, but for their actual needs, their actual bodies, their actual hearts.

As Miles's paw found hers, his claws gently tracing the pattern they both knew by heart, she felt that familiar warmth spread through her chest. Later, when Sarah had retreated to her room, there would be other touches, other rituals—the private language they'd developed over twenty years together. But this moment had its own perfection: three different species, three different histories, finding home in each other's presence.

Outside, the rain fell harder, drumming against the windows in a rhythm that seemed to complement Lillian's playing. Inside, they were warm, they were safe, they were together. In a world that so often failed to make space for bodies and hearts like theirs, they had built this refuge—this house with its unspoken rules, its careful accommodations, its quiet insistence that love could take any form if you were brave enough to let it.
