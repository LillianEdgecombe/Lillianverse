    <h1>About the Lillianverse</h1>
    <section class="blurb">
      <p>Have you ever tried to imagine how your life would have been if you took a different choice? What if you lived in another time? Or were a different person entirely? If you said 'yes' to at least one of those questions, enter the Lillianverse!</p>
      <p>In the Lillianverse, each story tells a different version of the same character, Lillian, each time with a different twist: a different occupation, a different life history, a different epoch, a different gender or even species. All stories are organized by theme to help you find exactly the kind of adventure you're looking for.</p>
      <p>Have fun and enjoy exploring the infinite possibilities!</p>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>The Lillianverse is a passion project exploring the infinite possibilities of storytelling through the lens of a single character experiencing countless different lives. Each universe represents a different genre, theme, or approach to narrative, allowing for both familiar and experimental storytelling.</p>
      <p>This project celebrates the idea that every choice we make creates a new reality, and every story we tell opens a door to understanding ourselves and others in new ways.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the project aims at developing a collaborative interface between human and artificial imagination and creativity, employing different AI models and algorithms to drive story development and outline - always retaining full creative control over the writing and always layering a final human touch to give each story its real "voice," something that no machine would ever be able to do.</p>
